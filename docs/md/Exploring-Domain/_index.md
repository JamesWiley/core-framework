# Running Domain in the IDE

> **WARNING**:  The IDE has been deprecated as of REDHAWK version 3.0.0.

The [Domain Manager](../Runtime-Environment/domain-manager.html) contains knowledge of all existing CORBA-enabled objects installed or loaded onto the system. This includes references to all file systems (through the <abbr title="See Glossary.">File Manager</abbr>), <abbr title="See Glossary.">Device Managers</abbr>, and all <abbr title="See Glossary.">applications</abbr> (and their Resources). The Domain Manager is seen as the central bookkeeper. The REDHAWK IDE can be used to run or connect to a running <abbr title="See Glossary.">domain</abbr>, view the contents of a running domain, and launch and interact with applications within the domain.
