# Creating REDHAWK Projects

This section describes the different types of REDHAWK projects and how to create them using the provided Wizards. Before creating a new project, it is recommended that the IDE be in the [REDHAWK perspective](workbench.html) so that the proper menus are available.

To create a new REDHAWK project, click **File > New > Project**, and then select the project type.

The IDE displays the Select a wizard window, which prompts the user to select from multiple project types. Each project type has a custom Wizard to guide users through the initial creation process.


##### Common Fields
Some basic fields within the new project Wizard are common to all project types and include:

  - **Project Name**: A project name that is unique to the current <abbr title="See Glossary.">workspace</abbr>. Projects can be namespaced by adding dots in the name. Project names may not begin with a number and may not contain special characters other than dots for the namespace. Namespacing projects provides the ability to uniquely identify projects that share the same base name but have different implementations and also provides a logical grouping of resources. For example, the REDHAWK basic assets are namspaced as `rh.xxxx`.
  
> **TIP**  
> The Wizard dialog detects errors and informs the user if there is an invalid entry.  

  - **Location**: By default the location of the project is set to the current workspace. This may be changed by deselecting the **Use default location** check box and providing a custom location.

  - **Working sets**: A working set is an Eclipse concept and provides an additional layer of organization to the project workspace. A user may put common projects into a single "working set" to visually organize the **<abbr title="See Glossary.">Project Explorer</abbr>**. Additional options become available when projects are placed in working sets allowing the user to build, refresh, and search based on a specific working set. While it may resemble a folder, a working set does not create a new directory on the file system and the same project may belong to multiple working sets.

### REDHAWK Component Project

The **New Component Project Wizard** is a three page wizard that walks the user through creating a new REDHAWK <abbr title="See Glossary.">component</abbr>, selecting a programming language, and selecting a code generator. Many of the fields found within the component project wizard are also found within the device project wizard. Fields common to all new project wizards are defined in [Common Fields](#common-fields).

Page one of the component wizard contains:

  - **Contents**: A REDHAWK component is defined by an Software Package Descriptor (SPD) file. By default, when creating a new component, the SPD file created is an empty skeleton. A new component may be based off of a previous component's SPD file by selecting it from the file system.
  - **Component ID**: Every SoftPkg element contains an ID which is used for universally unique identification. The IDE generates a DCE compliant UUID by default.

Page two of the wizard defines the component's implementation, the programming language used and the code generation template.

The content found on this page includes:

  - **Prog. Lang**: A component's implementation may be written in either C++, Java, or Python.
  - **Code Generator**: The REDHAWK IDE provides a single code generator for each of the programming languages. It is possible to augment the IDE with additional code generators. A user may choose to forgo automatic code generation and instead choose to create their implementation manually.

  - **ID**: Each language implementation has a project unique ID. By default the language chosen is used as the ID.
  - **Description**: A component's implementation may contain a description. The description is written into the component's SPD file.

Page three of the wizard allows the user to customize the properties of the code generator and template.

Wizard page three contains fields for:

  - **Generator**: A read only label displaying the code generator being configured. This is the code generator that was chosen on the previous wizard page.
  - **Template**: The code generator may provide multiple templates to choose from. Each template may contain unique properties that may be set from the properties section.
  - **Output Directory**: The folder created to house the generated code.
  - **Package**: Available only for Java implementations. The Java package to place auto-generated code within.
  - **Properties**: Different code generation templates may provide configuration properties. Mouse hovering over the individual property provides information about the property.

Click **Finish** to complete the new project creation wizard.

### REDHAWK Control Panel Project

The **New Control Panel Project Wizard** is a two to three page wizard that walks the user through creating a new Plug-in project and optionally, generating a fully functioning project based off of supplied template projects. The New Control Panel Project Wizard is taken directly from the Eclipse New Plug-in Project Wizard and contains identical fields. Refer to the Eclipse documentation for more information.

### REDHAWK Device Project

The **New Device Project Wizard** is a three page wizard that walks the user through creating a new REDHAWK <abbr title="See Glossary.">device</abbr>, selecting a programming language, and selecting a code generator.

In the wizard, the user specifies the physical properties of the device, including whether the device ingests or outputs GPS and if the device has digital or analog input and output <abbr title="See Glossary.">ports</abbr>. Additionally, the user can choose to augment the required tuner status <abbr title="See Glossary.">properties</abbr> with additional optional properties.

### REDHAWK Interface Description Language (IDL) Project

The **IDL Project Wizard** is a one page wizard that walks the user through creating a new REDHAWK IDL project. Fields common to all new project wizards are defined in [Common Fields](#common-fields).

> **NOTE**  
> If you upgrade to REDHAWK version 2.0, and your custom IDL project references the Core Framework (CF) IDLs, compiler errors may be displayed. To resolve the errors, create a new IDL project and import your IDL files into the new project. The new project contains an updated `Makefile.am` that accounts for changes in the REDHAWK 2.0 IDL files.  

### REDHAWK Node Project

The **New Node Project Wizard** is a one to two page wizard that walks the user through creating a new REDHAWK <abbr title="See Glossary.">node</abbr> and optionally, placing devices into the new node. Fields common to all new project wizards are defined in [Common Fields](#common-fields).

  - **Node ID**: Every DCD contains an ID which is used for universally unique identification. The IDE generates a DCE compliant UUID by default.

The wizard may be completed at this point by clicking **Finish** or the user may continue to the optional second page.

On page two the user chooses what devices/services make up this node. This may be changed after the node's creation from the <abbr title="See Glossary.">Node Editor</abbr>.

Select **Finish** to complete the new project creation wizard.

### REDHAWK Octave Project

The [**Octave Wizard**](octave-wizard.html) enables users to import existing Octave M-files for easy conversion into REDHAWK C++ components.

In the wizard, the user specifies the project name and can then generate a simple set of code files to begin adding in library functions.

## REDHAWK Waveform Project

The **New Waveform Project Wizard** is a one to two page wizard that walks the user through creating a new REDHAWK <abbr title="See Glossary.">waveform</abbr> and optionally, assigning an <abbr title="See Glossary.">Assembly Controller</abbr>. Fields common to all new project wizards are defined in [Common Fields](#common-fields).

Page one of the wizard contains:
